      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>When and where is the ceremony?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The ceremony begins at <strong>2 PM on Sunday, June 7, 2026</strong> at Willamette Mission State Park, 10991 Wheatland Road NE, Keizer, OR 97303. The reception follows immediately after.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What time should I arrive?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Please plan to arrive by <strong>1:30 PM</strong> so you have time to park, find your seat, and settle in before the 2 PM ceremony.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is there parking at the venue?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes. Willamette Mission State Park has on-site parking. An Oregon State Parks day-use fee ($5) applies — you can pay at the entrance kiosk. We recommend arriving a few minutes early to allow for that.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What is the dress code?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p><strong>Semi-formal / garden party attire.</strong> The ceremony is outdoors, so comfortable shoes are a wise choice. Expect warm Oregon June weather — light layers for the evening are a good idea.</p>
          <p>Feel free to wear any color you like; there is no restricted palette for guests.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is the ceremony indoors or outdoors?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The ceremony will be held <strong>outdoors</strong> in the park. The reception area is covered. Oregon summers are typically warm and dry, but we will have a contingency plan if the weather is unkind.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can I take photos during the ceremony?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>We ask that guests keep phones away and be fully present during the ceremony itself — our photographer Daniel Thomas will be capturing everything beautifully. You are absolutely welcome to take photos during the reception.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What food will be served?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The reception will feature a celebration meal. Dietary information collected via RSVP will be used to accommodate restrictions. More details will be shared closer to the date.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Where should I stay?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The park is located between Salem and Keizer, Oregon. Nearby accommodation options include hotels in Salem (approx. 15 minutes south) and Keizer (approx. 10 minutes east). We recommend booking early — summer weekends fill up quickly in the Willamette Valley.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can I bring a plus-one or children?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Invitations specify the number of guests included. If your invitation is addressed to you and a guest, you are welcome to bring one. If you have questions about your invitation, please reach out to us directly.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do you have a gift registry?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes — you can browse our registry at <a href="/registry/">hanstan.wedding/registry</a>. Your presence is the greatest gift; the registry is simply there if you'd like to give something.</p>
